# The-Creative-Key---Exceptional-Website-Template
An exquisite website template with beautifully designed and strongly implemented code. This website uses PHP for back-end purposes.

This is a complete website template with back-end and front-end integrated into php files. The website has been built for smooth customer experience and it integrates blogs using Wordpress.
I hope to buy a hosting service and put this website up for review soon, given that this is one of my best works, I believe.  
  
## SQL Files and Tables

The SQL file with all the tables has been included within the root folder itself with the name "urjentupccodes.sql".
